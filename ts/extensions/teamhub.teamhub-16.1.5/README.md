### GitLive helps you and your fellow contributors merge faster by avoiding conflicts and encouraging eager and continuous code review directly inside the IDE.

<br>

## **Do not let merge conflicts break your flow**

### **Indicators in the gutter of your editor show the changes others are making.** Computed from all active branches, the indicators update as you and your team code together.
### **Get notified the moment you make a change that conflicts with another branch.** Compare their changes to your own and cherry‑pick individual changes directly into your local files.

## **Get the ultimate perspective on all work in progress**

### **Perform eager and continuous code review directly in your IDE with the team view.** See who is online, their active branches and changes in a single repository or across your organization, updated in real‑time.
### **Get notified when you fall behind the main branch or your tracking branch.** Inspect the changed files in the repository view to know if they will merge cleanly with your own local changes before you pull.

## **Let your team know what you are working on**

### **Connect your issue tracker to see each other's current issue in the team view.** The issue you are working on is determined by your current branch and updates automatically.
### **View your current issue and select another issue to work on via the status bar.** Switching issues will check out an existing feature branch or create a new one for you if needed.
